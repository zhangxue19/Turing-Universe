# 图灵奖 Turing Award

### 起源

图灵奖，是由美国计算机协会（ACM）于1966年为纪念计算机诞生20周年而设立的一个奖项，也是ACM所设立的第一个奖项。这个奖以计算技术的先驱、英国科学家图灵命名，用以奖励在计算机科学研究中作出创造性贡献，推动了计算机技术发展的杰出科学家。

图灵奖对获奖条件要求极高，评奖程序极严，一般每年仅授予一名计算机科学家。

图灵奖是计算机领域的国际最高奖项，被誉为“计算机界的诺贝尔奖”。 

#### Origin

The Turing Award is an award set up by Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) in 1966 to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the birth of computers. It is also the first award set up by ACM. This award is named after British scientist Turing, a pioneer in computing technology, and is used to reward outstanding scientists who have made creative contributions in computer science research and promoted the development of computer technology.

The Turing Award has extremely high requirements for awarding conditions and strict award procedures. Generally, only one computer scientist is awarded each year.

The Turing Award is the highest international award in the computer field and is known as the "Nobel Prize in the computer industry".



### 评审制度

每年，美国计算机协会将要求提名人推荐本年度的图灵奖候选人，并附加一篇文章说明推荐理由。任何人都可成为提名人。美国计算机协会将组成评选委员会，对被提名者进行严格的评审，并最终确定当年的获奖者。

#### Evaluation system

Every year, Association for Computing Machinery will ask nominators to recommend candidates for the Turing Award this year and attach an article explaining the reason for the recommendation. Anyone can become a nominee. Association for Computing Machinery will form a selection committee to conduct a rigorous review of the nominees, and finally determine the winners of the year.

 

### 奖金

1.  据说，图灵奖金的最早赞助人是贝尔实验室，奖金只有几千美元。
2. 图灵奖的奖金在设奖初期为20万美元，1989年起增到25万美元。
3. 2014年11月13日之前图灵奖由英特尔公司以及Google公司赞助，奖金为25万美元。2014年11月13日，虽然英特尔退出赞助，Google反而将奖金提高到100万美元，和诺贝尔奖奖金相近。ACM宣布，“图灵奖奖金将翻四倍，旨在提高对计算机科学的重视和认可”。Google副总裁 Stuart Feldman 说，Google 之所以重金投入图灵奖，是因为 “计算机科学是我们的命脉，我们希望让公众给予它更多的关注和认可。”

#### bonus

1. It is said that the earliest patron of the Turing Award was Bell Labs, and the prize was only a few thousand dollars.
2. The prize of the Turing Award was \$200,000 at the beginning of the award, and since 1989 it increased to \$250,000.
3. Before November 13, 2014, the Turing Award was sponsored by Intel and Google, and the prize was \$250,000. On November 13, 2014, although Intel withdrew from the sponsorship, Google instead increased the bonus to \$1 million, which was similar to the Nobel Prize. ACM announced that "the Turing Award will be quadrupled to increase the importance and recognition of computer science." Google vice president Stuart Feldman said that Google invested heavily in the Turing Award because "Computer science is our lifeblood, and we hope that the public will give it more attention and recognition."



### 奖杯

图灵奖的奖杯是一只银碗。至于为什么是一只碗的形状，我没有找到官方的说法。有一种说法是和奖杯的杯状物意义一样，起源于中世纪，胜利后用杯状物作为奖励的象征，里面会装满金银珠宝的奖励品。另一种说法是第一个奖杯是根据碗形体育场设计的，美国人习惯了这个碗形，后面就延续下来了。

#### Trophy

The trophy of the Turing Award is a silver bowl. As for why it is in the shape of a bowl, I have not found an official statement. There is a saying that it has the same meaning as the cup of the trophy. It originated in the Middle Ages. After victory, the cup was used as a symbol of reward, and it would be filled with gold and silver jewelry rewards. Another theory is that the first trophy was designed based on the bowl-shaped stadium. The Americans were used to this bowl-shape and continued later.

 

### 获奖演说

“图灵奖演说”是图灵奖获得者在授奖仪式上所发表的演说，这ACM的一个传统。图灵奖的得主在这些演说中或畅谈自己成功的经验和体会，或阐明计算机科学某一技术领域的精髓，或发表对某些热点问题的看法。这些演说一般发表在历年的《ACM通讯》中，只有前5年发表在《ACM杂志》上。1987年，ACM出版社把前20届图灵奖演说汇集成书——《ACM Turing Lectures——The First Twenty Years:1996-1985》

#### Turing Award Speech

"Turing Award Speech" is a speech delivered by Turing Award winners at the award ceremony, which is a tradition of ACM. In these speeches, Turing Award winners either talked freely about their own successful experience and experience, or clarified the essence of a certain technical field of computer science, or expressed their views on certain hot issues. These speeches are generally published in Communications of the ACM (CACM) over the years, and only in ACM Magazine in the first 5 years. In 1987, ACM Publishing compiled the first 20 Turing Award speeches into a book: ACM Turing Lectures - The First Twenty Years: 1996-1985

 

### 相关知识：ACM

ACM成立于1947年，也就是世界上第一台电子计算机ENIAC诞生以后的第二年，美国一些有远见的科学家意识到它对于社会进步和人类文明的巨大意义，因此发起成立了这个协会，以推动计算机科学技术的发展和学术交流。ACM目前已成为计算机界最有影响的两大国际性组织之一。

ACM于1947年9月15日在纽约的哥伦比亚大学成立之初的名称是“东部计算机协会”，后来把东部这个词去掉成为“计算机协会”。协会章程和附则是两年后才通过的。章程规定协会的目的有三：

1. 推进信息处理科学和技术，包括计算机、计算技术和程序设计语言的研究，设计，开发和应用，也包括过程的自动控制和模拟。
2. 维护信息处理科学和技术在专业人员和大众中的自由交流。
3. 维护信息处理科学和技术从业人员的权益。

 #### related information: ACM

ACM was founded in 1947, which is the second year after the birth of the world’s first electronic computer ENIAC. Some visionary scientists in the United States realized its great significance for social progress and human civilization, so they initiated the establishment of this association. Promote the development of computer science and technology and academic exchanges. ACM has become one of the two most influential international organizations in the computer industry.

The name of ACM at the beginning of its establishment at Columbia University in New York on September 15, 1947 was Eastern Association for Computing Machinery, and later the term "Eastern" was removed to become Association for Computing Machinery. The articles of association and by-laws were passed two years later. The articles of association stipulate that there are three purposes of the association:

1. Advance the science and technology of information processing, including the research, design, development and application of computers, computing technology and programming languages, as well as the automatic control and simulation of processes.
2. Maintain the free exchange of information processing science and technology among professionals and the general public.
3. Safeguard the rights and interests of information processing science and technology practitioners.
